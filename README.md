# Chaos-Pattern-and-Physics
This Repository will give you an idea of the relationship between chaos, fractal and physics.

This project is inspired from the video [The relationship between Chaos, Fractal and Physics](https://youtu.be/C5Jkgvw-Z6E)

# The video pattern:

# My Pattern:

## Note:
The video uses 3 magnets and a pendulum. In my case, The freely moving ball moves due to force of gravity exerted by the 3 stationary objects(stars).
