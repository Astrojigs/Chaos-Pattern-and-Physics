# Chaos-Pattern-and-Physics
This Repository will give you an idea of the relationship between chaos, fractal and physics.

This project is inspired from the video [The relationship between Chaos, Fractal and Physics](https://youtu.be/C5Jkgvw-Z6E)


## Step one:
This step calculates the trajectory and plots it.<br>
**For example:**

![Trajectory of planet](https://github.com/Astrojigs/Chaos-Pattern-and-Physics/blob/main/trajectory.jpg)

## Step two:
Now we mark the initial position of the planet with the same color as the star it collided with.

The first try was for **100 points** between 0 to 10 on both axes.

The second try was for **500 points** between 0 to 10 on both axes.

The third try was for **2000 points** between 0 to 10 on both axes.

## Note:
The video uses 3 magnets and a pendulum. In my case, The freely moving ball moves due to force of gravity exerted by the 3 stationary objects(stars).
